  descr: "The prestigious University Rover Challenge held at the Mars Desert Research Station every year. We are tasked to design and manufacture a Mars Rover from scratch that may be able to perform tasks according to URC guidelines. In this iteration of the challenge, we were the only team from South-East Asia to proceed to the 2nd round of evaluation (Systems Acceptance Review). Unfortunately, URC2020 was cancelled due to COVID-19, nevertheless we had an enriching experience."
